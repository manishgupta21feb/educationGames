There are six wheels located at each wheel location on the bottom of the car. There are two wheels that contact the track from above, two wheels that contact the track from the side, and two wheels that contact the track from below. This combination of wheels and placement keeps the car secured to the track.",
        detail2: "<b>The force of friction</b> is working as the six wheels move along the steel track because the wheels rub against the steel track. Similarly, when the car approaches a large hill, the track has large tires that are used to propel the car up the hill at a speed of about 5â€“8 mph. The increase in <b>friction</b> between the car and the coaster-tire combination forces the car up the hill of the track. This is an example of the applied force of the track tires on the car. An <b>applied force</b> is used to make the car move against the pull of <b>gravity</b> and the force of <b>friction.</b> The pull of gravity would not allow the car to move up the hill. Track tires are also used at the braking location at the end of the track. There, track tires use an <b>applied force</b> to slow the car down rather than to speed it up.",

The roller-coaster car reaches a point on the track where there are large magnets used for braking, or reducing speed, on both sides of the car. The large <b>magnets </b/> on each side of the car create a <b>magnetic field</b> with a current between the track and the car. The strong <b>force of magnetism</b> creates a <b>magnetic field.</b> This attracts the roller-coaster car to the <b>magnets</b>, and forces the car to slow down. Some roller coasters have <b>magnetic propulsion</b> to force the car up a large hill, rather than track tires or a chain system. In this part of the track, the attraction of <b>magnetic fields</b> between the track and roller-coaster car helps to quickly accelerate the car rather than decelerate the car." },
